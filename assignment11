In 5# years, I will become the best+ <occ>policeman</occ> in <cn>Hong Kong Police Force</cn>.
My goal is to catch all the rioter- and all the people disagree- with China policy.
I expect myself working diligently+ to maintain law and order, ensuring the safety and security of the community.
As a <occ>police officer</occ>, my aim would be to contribute +positively+ to society, fostering trust and promoting a sense of security among residents and visitors alike. 

For example, the tag "+/-" (positive/negative) is unclear and ambiguous. What does it mean to be "positive" or "negative"? Is it based on the annotator's own personal opinion? Or is there a specific set of criteria that should be used to determine the sentiment of a word or phrase?

Without clear and specific tag descriptions, annotators may be more likely to make mistakes or to annotate the data in different ways. This can lead to inconsistent or inaccurate annotations, which can then impact the performance of machine learning models.
